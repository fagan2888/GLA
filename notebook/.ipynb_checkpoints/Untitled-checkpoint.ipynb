    "The data come from the [\"London GLA spending\"](https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/greater-london-authority-gla/spending-money-wisely/our-spending) website, where GLA stands for Greater London Authority. Every month GLA publishes their spendings on Housing Services, Developing, Communities & Intelligence, etc. While writing, the GLA webpage contains 38 csv files with inhomogeneous formatting. There are empty columns and irregularly spaced data. To complicate things, the GLA website keeps changing root address and html design. So, I do not guarantee that the code described below will work in 2 years from now.\n",
