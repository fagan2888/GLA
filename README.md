This is source-code behind the analysis of the London GLA (Greater London Authority) that I published on [my blog](https://vincepota.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/analysis-of-london-spendings-with-python/).

[This jupyter-notebook](https://github.com/vincepota/GLA/blob/master/notebook/notebook.ipynb) explains the code in detail and discusses the results. 

Data are web-scraped from [this website](https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/greater-london-authority-gla/spending-money-wisely/our-spending) and saved in `output.csv` as a comma-separated table.
